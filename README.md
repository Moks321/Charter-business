# Charter-business
A web based system was developed for a yacht charter company to manage aspects of its holiday charter business. 
The information held on this system are:
•	the name, nationality, email address, phone number and id number of each customer.
•	the name, type, model, home port, number of berths and cost of hire per day of each yacht.
•	the name, phone number, email address and number of docking places at each port.
•	the charter id, start date and duration of each charter, and the visit id, expected date of arrival and duration of stay at each port visited.

The system has ability to:
•	add details of a new customer together with the start date and duration of the charter they have booked, but without specifying the yacht to be used or the ports to be visited.
•	list the total length of stay, between two given dates, of yachts in the fleet in each port.
•	get a list of yachts (by name) visiting their home port between two given dates, together with the date of arrival and the length of the stay.
•	list the ports visited by a given customer together with the date of arrival and length of stay, ordered by date.
•	remove a yacht temporarily for a period of time (e.g., for servicing) and get a list of yachts that are not available,
